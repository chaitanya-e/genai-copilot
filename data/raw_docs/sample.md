# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.  
It has applications in areas such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

## Automation

AI enables automation by performing repetitive tasks faster and with fewer errors than humans.  
For example, AI-powered chatbots can handle customer queries 24/7, and automated systems can monitor equipment for predictive maintenance.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where machines improve their performance using data without explicit programming.  
ML algorithms can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement-based.

## Benefits and Risks

While AI offers many benefits, including efficiency and scalability, it also poses risks such as job displacement and ethical concerns.  
Responsible AI development involves fairness, transparency, and accountability.
